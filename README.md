Feedback:
- reviews_all is great when you want to get all the available reviews but it can be problematic sometimes because you might hit the rate limit easily, and Be hard to control especially in production. Try reviews with pagination. 

- It would be interesting to enrich your dashboard a tad just to get a feel of what the serving layer does.

- For a cleaner code always separate layers. For instance, in your source folder, have a code file for capture, another for transformation, and another for serving
  
- Please add a screenshot of your dashboard to the readmefile
